# A Template for d3 visualizations: 

I spend way to much time setting up the actual environment for each visualization I make. 

## Get it running: 
(From the terminal)
```{sh}
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```
now simply navigate to `localhost:8000` in your browser of choice (which should be chrome). 

## Includes: 
- D3
- Bootstrap
- My google tracking code
- JQuery
